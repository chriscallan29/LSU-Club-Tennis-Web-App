## LSU Club Tennis Team Web Application
This project is intended to be used for recruitment, team management, and any other sort of practical application that the LSU Club Tennis Team could potentially utilize to benefit the team.

## Description
I've been a member/officer of the LSU Club Tennis Team since I came to LSU four years ago. The club has always lacked something, whether it be players, funds, involvement, etc. As a result, the team has always been a bit disorganized or lacking in motivation due to an inefficient work system. I wanted to create this web application as a way for the team to centralize the team around, as well as have a source of consistent recruitment where potential players can learn about our team since recruitment was the most prevelant issue we faced. Additionally, this served as a great outlet for me to learn more about Angular and developing my own front-end application, from UX design to launch.
